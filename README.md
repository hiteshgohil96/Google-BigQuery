# Google-BigQuery
SQL Scavenger Hunt

I started to read about Big Data and I was amazed at how Google has given us the platform to get access to big datasets i.e in gigabytes, terabytes etc. <br>
Today, I successfully completed SQL Scavenger Hunt on Kaggle which gave me a great start on using Google BigQuery.
I used BigQuery to extract the public large datasets i.e global_air_quality, hacker news, US traffic fatality records, bitcoins & GitHub (which has multiple datasets with observations in millions) by writing SQL queries on the python platform for analysis.
I have shared some of the images of my work with SQL queries and some basic graphs.
